Week 1
================
## Week challenges (Tuesday)

1. Watch this video about compilation and interpretation :white_check_mark:

2. Search and answer the question:  :white_check_mark:Java language is compiled or interpreted? :white_check_mark: Java can be considered both a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code is first compiled into a binary byte-code. This byte-code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is usually a software-based interpreter.

3. Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD :white_check_mark:
function currency(num) {
  let usd = num * 7.5;
  return `You'r equivalent of ${num} quetzales to dollars is ${usd}`;
 }

4. Read about Pseudocode here, you can also find some examples here :white_check_mark:

5. Anwser to the question: Why is pseudocode helpful? :white_check_mark: Because it helps you thinking on understanding and solving a problem without the logical part

6. Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like  for example i could define Y <-- 2022) :white_check_mark:
  -Define current year
  -Get the year the user was born as a parameter
  -Create a conditional 
    (if parameter is more than current year then 'is is not a valid year)
    (else if parameter is equal or more than current then (substract current year minus parameter)
  -Return the conditional result

7. Read about flowcharts here :white_check_mark:

8. Answer to the question: Why are flowcharts important to us as developers? :white_check_mark: It is a pseudocode method that ease the understanding of logic

9. Search about High-level languages and Low-level languages, you can start with this video :white_check_mark:

## Week challenges (Wednesday)

1. Learn about binary, decimal and hexadecimal numbers :white_check_mark: 

2. Translate the year you where born to binary, decimal and hexadecimal :white_check_mark:
  - Decimal = 1994
  - Binary  = 11111001010
  - Hex = 7CA

3. Translate 51966 into hexadecimal and binary :white_check_mark:
  - Decimal = 51966
  - Binary = 1100101011111110
  - Hex = CAFE

4. Use a Low-level language, for example MIPS aseembler, to do so, you will need to follow this guide. We recomend to check the guide first but also this presentation could be helpful. :white_check_mark:

5. Base on the examples and the guide of the low-level language: 5.1 Create a program to add two numbers given by the user 5.2 Create a program that display your name :white_check_mark:

## Week challenges (Thursday)

1. Search for real word applications of Javascript :white_check_mark:

### Usos de JavaScript en la actualidad

+ Creaci칩n de p치ginas web.
+ Desarrollo de todo el backend de una aplicaci칩n, programando con Node. js, que sigue siendo JavaScript.
+ Sistemas operativos.
+ Servidores de Internet.
