Core Code bootcamp

## Week 1
### Week challenges (Tuesday)

1. Watch this video about compilation and interpretation :white_check_mark:
2. Search and answer the question:  :white_check_mark:Java language is compiled or interpreted? :white_check_mark: Java can be considered both a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code is first compiled into a binary byte-code. This byte-code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is usually a software-based interpreter.
3. Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD :white_check_mark:

function currency(num) {
  let usd = num * 7.5;
  return `You'r equivalent of ${num} quetzales to dollars is ${usd}`;
 }

4. Read about Pseudocode here, you can also find some examples here :white_check_mark:
5. Anwser to the question: Why is pseudocode helpful? :white_check_mark: Because it helps you thinking on understanding and solving a problem without the logical part
6. Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like  for example i could define Y <-- 2022) :white_check_mark:
  
  -Define current year
  -Get the year the user was born as a parameter
  -Create a conditional 
    (if parameter is more than current year then 'is is not a valid year)
    (else if parameter is equal or more than current then (substract current year minus parameter)
  -Return the conditional result

7. Read about flowcharts here :white_check_mark:
8. Answer to the question: Why are flowcharts important to us as developers? :white_check_mark: It is a pseudocode method that ease the understanding of logic
9. Search about High-level languages and Low-level languages, you can start with this video :white_check_mark:
